Feed Line Width:        3.0 mm
Feed Line Extension:    20.0 mm (beyond patch edge)

SUBSTRATE SPECIFICATIONS:
------------------------
Material:               FR-4
Thickness:              1.6 mm
Relative Permittivity:  4.3 @ 868 MHz
Loss Tangent:           0.02
Board Size:             142 × 119.3 mm (minimum)
                        (102 + 40 margin) × (79.3 + 40 margin)

COPPER SPECIFICATIONS:
---------------------
Copper Weight:          35 μm (1 oz) standard
Top Layer:              Patch antenna + feed line
Bottom Layer:           Solid ground plane
Finish:                 HASL or ENIG (both work fine)

FEED POINT:
-----------
Location:               Center of feed line, 10mm below patch
Type:                   SMA edge connector or U.FL connector
Impedance:              50 Ω

PCB LAYER STACKUP:
-----------------
Layer 1 (Top):     Copper (patch + feed) - 35 μm
Core:              FR-4 dielectric - 1.6 mm
Layer 2 (Bottom):  Copper (ground plane) - 35 μm

DESIGN NOTES FOR PCB LAYOUT:
----------------------------
1. The patch is centered on the board
2. Feed line extends from bottom edge toward patch center
3. Inset notch cuts into patch from bottom edge by 27mm
4. Ground plane should be continuous on bottom layer
5. No vias needed (simple 2-layer design)
6. Add 2mm holes at corners for mounting (optional)

CONNECTOR OPTIONS:
------------------
Option A: SMA Edge Mount
  - Solder SMA edge connector to feed line
  - Ground tabs solder to bottom ground plane
  - Most robust for testing

Option B: U.FL Connector
  - Smaller profile
  - Solder center pin to feed line
  - Ground ring solders to ground plane via
  - Good for integration

MANUFACTURING TOLERANCES:
------------------------
Standard PCB tolerances (±0.1mm) are acceptable
This will shift resonance by ±2-3 MHz max (acceptable)

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE (from simulation):
--------------------------------------
Resonant Frequency:     ~868 MHz
Return Loss (S11):      < -20 dB at resonance
Bandwidth (S11 < -10dB): ~20-30 MHz
Gain:                   ~6-7 dBi
Radiation Pattern:      Broadside (perpendicular to PCB)
Impedance:              50 Ω at resonance

FILE NAMING FOR ORDERING:
------------------------
Suggested PCB name: "868MHz_Patch_Antenna_v1"
